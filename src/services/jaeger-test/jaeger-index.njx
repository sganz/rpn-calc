 <h1>Jaeger Test Page</h1>
 {% block content %}
  This test page will make a call to an express service that will in turn 
  make a call to the main app that has a /time endpoint. The /time service will
  delay 100ms and return the time as a JSON package. Once you hit this page
  go back to the Jaeger service web page and take a look.
